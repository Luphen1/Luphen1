2. Focus on producing more expensive cars as they generate higher revenue.
   
3. Increase production in Los Angeles to boost car sales, while maintaining a favorable production level in Dallas.
   
4. Emphasize Hyundai brand cars as they are profitable products to generate revenue.
   
5. Prioritize the production of white cars, as they have the potential to generate more revenue for the company.

6. Implement a strategy to increase production rates of Toyota, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Ford, and Honda across all locations

- [Heart-Attack-Portfolio-Project](https://github.com/Luphen1/Heart-Attack-Portfolio-Project-)

	Excel - Used for data cleaning to check for missing values and duplicate records across the spreadsheet to enhance data integrity.
	MySQL - Utilized for enhancing the dataset by creating a new column type for data manipulation and data structure.
	Power BI - Employed for creating dynamic dashboard reports.

The analysis results are summarized as follows:


1.	Females have the highest occurrence of gender in the dataset.
   
2.	The young adult age group has the highest glucose variation.
	
3.	The elder age group has the highest occurrence of gender.
	
4.	Adults have the highest impulse above average in the dataset.
	
5.	The elder age group has the highest occurrence of age in the dataset.
	
6.	The senior age group has the highest average glucose.
	
7.	The senior age group is most at risk of high blood pressure.
	
8.	The elder age group has the highest average troponin.
	
9.	There is a high risk of heart attack in the dataset due to average glucose.
	
10.	The elder age group has the highest risk of heart attack in the dataset.
	
11.	The young adult age group has the highest percentage of high blood pressure attacks, while teenagers have the lowest percentage of low blood pressure.
    


Based on my analysis, I recommend the following actions:


1. Increase Healthcare Access: Provide more frequent health check-ups for young adults to address and prevent high blood pressure.
