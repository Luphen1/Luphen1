## üëã Hello World! I'm Oluwafemi Stephen Odebunmi 

Passionate about unraveling insights from data to drive informed decisions. üìä Aspiring Data Analyst with a knack for transforming raw data into compelling narratives. üí°

### üöÄ What I Bring to the Table:

- **Analytical Skills:** Proficient in extracting meaningful patterns and trends from complex datasets.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating compelling visualizations that tell a story and make data accessible.
- **Tools Mastery:** Experienced with MySQL,Excel and Power BI
- **Problem Solving:** Thrive on solving real-world problems through data-driven approaches.

### üå± Currently Exploring:

- Advanced statistical analysis techniques.
- Python 

### üìä Projects That Speak for Themselves:

- [CAR-DATASET-PORTFOLIO-PROJECT]
(#CAR-DATASET-PORTFOLIO-PROJECT): 
	Excel - Used for data cleaning to check for missing values and duplicate records across the spreadsheet to enhance data integrity.
	MySQL - Utilized for enhancing the dataset for data manipulation and data structure.
	Power BI - Employed for creating dynamic dashboard reports.

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1.	Toyota brand has higher mileage for each year of production.
   
2.	The price difference between the most expensive and cheapest car is $17,000.

3.	There should be more production of cars in Los Angeles, while Dallas has the most profitable production.
	
4.	Hyundai brand cars are significantly more profitable.
	
5.	High production of white cars would be advantageous and generate more revenue for the company.
	
6.	Hyundai has a higher coefficient of variation among car brands.
	
7.	Production of Honda and Ford cars in 2017 and 2018 generated more sales in those years.
	
Based on my analysis, I recommend the following actions:

1. Encourage the production of Toyota car brand for each year.
   
2. Focus on producing more expensive cars as they generate higher revenue.
   
3. Increase production in Los Angeles to boost car sales, while maintaining a favorable production level in Dallas.
   
4. Emphasize Hyundai brand cars as they are profitable products to generate revenue.
   
5. Prioritize the production of white cars, as they have the potential to generate more revenue for the company.

6. Implement a strategy to increase production rates of Toyota, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Ford, and Honda across all locations

- [Heart-Attack-Portfolio-Project](##https://github.com/Luphen1/Heart-Attack-Portfolio-Project-): 

	Excel - Used for data cleaning to check for missing values and duplicate records across the spreadsheet to enhance data integrity.
	MySQL - Utilized for enhancing the dataset by creating a new column type for data manipulation and data structure.
	Power BI - Employed for creating dynamic dashboard reports.
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.	Females have the highest occurrence of gender in the dataset.
   
2.	The young adult age group has the highest glucose variation.
	
3.	The elder age group has the highest occurrence of gender.
	
4.	Adults have the highest impulse above average in the dataset.
	
5.	The elder age group has the highest occurrence of age in the dataset.
	
6.	The senior age group has the highest average glucose.
	
7.	The senior age group is most at risk of high blood pressure.
	
8.	The elder age group has the highest average troponin.
	
9.	There is a high risk of heart attack in the dataset due to average glucose.
	
10.	The elder age group has the highest risk of heart attack in the dataset.
	
11.	The young adult age group has the highest percentage of high blood pressure attacks, while teenagers have the lowest percentage of low blood pressure.


Based on my analysis, I recommend the following actions:

1. Increased Healthcare for Young Adults: Implement more frequent healthcare check-ups and screenings for young adults to actively manage and reduce the risk of high blood pressure.
   
2. Specialized Education Program for Seniors: Establish a dedicated program aimed at educating seniors on lifestyle modifications and preventive measures to reduce the high risk of developing high blood pressure. This could include dietary changes, exercise routines, stress management techniques, and regular monitoring of blood pressure.

3. Promote Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Choices: Encourage individuals across all age groups to adopt heart-healthy habits such as maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, managing stress effectively, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.
   
4. Public Awareness Campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns to raise awareness about the risk factors associated with heart attacks and high blood pressure, targeting both younger and older demographics. These campaigns could include educational materials, workshops, and community events aimed at promoting cardiovascular health.
   
5. Accessible Healthcare Services: Ensure accessibility to healthcare services for all age groups, including affordable screenings, consultations, and treatment options for managing cardiovascular health. This may involve expanding healthcare infrastructure and resources in underserved areas.
   
6. Family and Community Support: Encourage family members and communities to support individuals in maintaining healthy lifestyles and adhering to medical recommendations for preventing heart disease and managing high blood pressure. This support network can play a crucial role in sustaining long-term behavioral changes and improving overall cardiovascular health outcomes.
